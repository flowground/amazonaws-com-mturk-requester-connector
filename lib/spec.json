The new HIT is made available for Workers to find and accept on the Amazon Mechanical Turk website. </p> <p> This operation allows you to specify a new HIT by passing in values for the properties of the HIT, such as its title, reward amount and number of assignments. When you pass these values to <code>CreateHIT</code>, a new HIT is created for you, with a new <code>HITTypeID</code>. The HITTypeID can be used to create additional HITs in the future without needing to specify common parameters such as the title, description and reward amount each time.</p> <p> An alternative way to create HITs is to first generate a HITTypeID using the <code>CreateHITType</code> operation and then call the <code>CreateHITWithHITType</code> operation. This is the recommended best practice for Requesters who are creating large numbers of HITs. </p> <p>CreateHIT also supports several ways to provide question data: by providing a value for the <code>Question</code> parameter that fully specifies the contents of the HIT, or by providing a <code>HitLayoutId</code> and associated <code>HitLayoutParameters</code>. </p> <note> <p> If a HIT is created with 10 or more maximum assignments, there is an additional fee.

However, the Name and Keywords fields cannot be modified. The RetryDelayInSeconds parameter can be modified or added to change the delay or to enable retries, but RetryDelayInSeconds cannot be used to disable retries. </p> <p> You can use this operation to update the test for a Qualification type. The test is updated based on the values specified for the Test, TestDurationInSeconds and AnswerKey parameters. All three parameters specify the updated test. If you are updating the test for a type, you must specify the Test and TestDurationInSeconds parameters. The AnswerKey parameter is optional; omitting it specifies that the updated test does not have an answer key. </p> <p> If you omit the Test parameter, the test for the Qualification type is unchanged. There is no way to remove a test from a Qualification type that has one. If the type already has a test, you cannot update it to be AutoGranted. If the Qualification type does not have a test and one is provided by an update, the type will henceforth have a test. </p> <p> If you want to update the test duration or answer key for an existing test without changing the questions, you must specify a Test parameter with the original questions, along with the updated values. </p> <p> If you provide an updated Test but no AnswerKey, the new test will not have an answer key.

If RequiredToPreview is true, the question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker's Qualifications must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT's question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the <code>ActionsGuarded</code> field. ",
